## Unreleased

### Added

- Added functions `final_grad()` and `final_grad_norm()` to `LBFGSSolver`
  and `LBFGSBSolver` to retrieve the final gradient information
  ([#12](https://github.com/yixuan/LBFGSpp/issues/12))

### Changed

- `LBFGS++` now requires C++11
- The line search classes now have a unified API for both `LBFGSSolver` and `LBFGSBSolver`
- The Moré-Thuente line search algorithm `LineSearchMoreThuente` now can also be used
  in the L-BFGS solver `LBFGSSolver`
- Improved the numerical stability of `LineSearchNocedalWright`
  ([#27](https://github.com/yixuan/LBFGSpp/issues/27))

### Changed

  [@mpayrits](https://github.com/mpayrits) ([#25](https://github.com/yixuan/LBFGSpp/pull/25))
- Fixed one inconsistency with Moré and Thuente (1994) in the `LineSearchMoreThuente`
  line search algorithm, pointed out by [@mpayrits](https://github.com/mpayrits)
  ([#23](https://github.com/yixuan/LBFGSpp/issues/23))
